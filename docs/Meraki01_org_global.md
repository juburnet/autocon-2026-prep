# Step 3 - Configure Organization Global Settings

Each lab pod shares one Meraki organization between two participants, so two
branch networks live side by side under the same org. The organization
itself is already created for you, along with a shared Datacenter network
that every branch VPNs into - this step doesn't create any of that, it
configures organization-level settings on top of it.

An organization in Cisco Meraki is the highest-level container in the cloud
Dashboard hierarchy - it represents a single company, institution, or
department, and every network you configure belongs to one. The
organization level is where settings apply to *everything* below it,
regardless of network or device. 

## Two Key Principles

Two principles underpin everything from here on:

- **Single source of truth.** The YAML under `data/` is the one place that
  defines what your branch network should look like. Nothing is meant to be
  configured ad hoc in the Dashboard outside of it - a manual change made
  there is configuration drift waiting to be overwritten the next time
  someone runs `terraform apply`.
- **Declarative, not imperative.** You declare *what* the organization
  should look like - a login security policy, an SNMPv3 user - not *how* to
  get there. There's no sequence of clicks or API calls to write or order;
  the module and provider work that out, and Terraform's own dependency
  graph decides what happens before what, not file order. That's also why
  it doesn't matter which file in `data/` you create first: every
  `.nac.yaml` file there gets deep-merged into one model before anything is
  validated or applied.

## Open and review the file

On your VSCode open `data/1_org_global.nac.yaml` and review the configuration. Near the top
you'll find the organization block with its environment-driven variables:

```yaml
organizations:
  - name: !env org_name
    managed: false
    login_security:
      enforce_password_expiration: false
      password_expiration_days: 40
      enforce_different_passwords: true
      num_different_passwords: 5
      enforce_strong_passwords: true
      enforce_account_lockout: true
      account_lockout_attempts: 5
      enforce_idle_timeout: true
      idle_timeout_minutes: 90
```

Notice that the organization's `name` uses the `org_name` variable, resolved
by the `!env` tag instead of being hardcoded. You'll set that value first in
your local `.env` file, and later in the GitLab CI/CD variables. 

In the provided file, there are other settings, such as SNMP as well as some firewall VPN rules. Examine the configuration. 

## Set your pod's values in `.env`

Edit the `.env` file you copied from `.env.example` earlier, and set
`org_name` to the Org ID your proctor gave you (also visible in the Meraki
Dashboard, as the `Org-[org_id]` pattern from Step 1):

```sh
export org_name=Org-12345678901234
```

Your proctor also provided you the serial numbers for your pod's devices - set
those too, along with a name of your own choosing for your branch network:

```sh
export branch_name=Your Own Branch Name
export branch_mx_serial=XXX-XXX-XXX
export branch_ms_serial=XXX-XXX-XXX
export branch_cw_serial=XXX-XXX-XXX
```

`branch_name` can be anything unique to you - for example `"Shawn's
Network"` - just pick something specific to you (like your own name), since
two branch networks share this organization.

!!! note "`!env` vs `${...}` - two different variable mechanisms"
    `!env VAR` (used throughout this file) pulls a value from your shell
    environment - `.env` locally, CI/CD variables in the pipeline - and is
    the mechanism for anything secret or pod-specific: API keys, org name,
    device serials, RADIUS secrets. `${VAR}` is a different mechanism you
    may see referenced in the schema docs: a template-scoped variable
    substituted at render time, used to make one template produce different
    output per site (non-sensitive values only). This lab's template step
    (step 7) sticks to static values for simplicity, but `${...}` is what
    you'd reach for if the same template needed to render differently for
    every branch.

Review the rest of the file: it's a deliberately small example that
demonstrates automating organization creation with just a few settings. 

## Source `.env` and Initialize Terraform

With all five variables set, source the file from the repo root so
Terraform's process picks them up, then `cd` into `meraki/` and initialize
the module - commands like `terraform init`/`plan`/`apply` always run from
`meraki/` or `ios-xe/`, never from the repository root:

```sh
source .env
cd meraki
terraform init
```

```text
Initializing the backend...

Initializing modules...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

!!! note "Re-source after editing `.env`"
    Variables are only read into your shell when you `source .env`. If you
    come back and edit `.env` later (a new serial, a different
    `branch_name`), `source .env` again before your next `terraform plan`
    or `apply` - otherwise Terraform still sees the old values.

## Finding the documentation

How do you know what configuration options are supported, and what YAML
structure they expect? The full data model is published on the Network as
Code docs site - for example, the schema for `login_security` is documented
at
[netascode.cisco.com/docs/data_models/meraki/organizations/general_management/login_security](https://netascode.cisco.com/docs/data_models/meraki/organizations/general_management/login_security/).

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Network as Code docs - Organization Login Security Configuration](assets/docs.png)<figcaption>The
  `netascode.cisco.com` schema reference for `organizations.login_security` -
  the field you're about to break on purpose below.</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! tip "Why `data/` only has one file so far"
    `meraki/data/` - the directory Terraform actually reads - starts with
    just `1_org_global.nac.yaml` in place. Every later step's file lives in
    `meraki/data-lab-task/` until it's that step's turn: you move (or copy)
    each file into `data/` as you reach it, which is what actually adds it
    to the merged model. `data-lab-task/` itself is never read by
    Terraform - it's a staging shelf, not a second source of truth.

## Validating before you deploy

Network as Code validation happens in two layers that catch different kinds
of mistakes, both running before anything touches the Dashboard:

- **Syntax (schema) validation** checks that your YAML is well-formed and
  that every value matches the schema's expected type, format, and range -
  wrong types, out-of-range numbers, missing required fields. It has no
  opinion on whether a value makes business sense, only whether it's a legal
  value for that field. Under the hood this runs on **Yamale**, a YAML
  schema validator - `meraki/.schema.yaml` is the blueprint it checks every
  file in `data/` against. This is what the `validate` stage of this repo's
  GitLab pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) runs on every push.
- **Semantic (business-rule) validation** goes further: custom logic runs
  against the parsed configuration to enforce policies a schema can't
  express on its own - e.g. "the administrator must never be named `root`".
  A file can pass every syntax check and still fail here.

### Try it: a syntax failure

`login_security.num_different_passwords` in this file is `5` (line 13).
`meraki/.schema.yaml` declares that field as `int(min=5, required=False)` -
`5` is the lowest legal value. From a terminal **in `meraki/`**, run
`nac-validate` against the file as-is first, to see a clean pass - it
auto-discovers `.schema.yaml` (and `.rules/`, if any rule applies) with no
extra flags needed:

```sh
nac-validate data/1_org_global.nac.yaml --verbosity DEBUG
```

```text
INFO - Artifact layer [local]: schema .schema.yaml
INFO - Loading of bundles and modules is disabled
INFO - Loading schema from .schema.yaml
INFO - No rules found at default path
INFO - Validate file: data/1_org_global.nac.yaml

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Validation Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ✓ Syntax validation: PASSED (1 files)
  ✓ Semantic validation: PASSED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Now temporarily lower `num_different_passwords` to `3` (line 13) and run
the exact same command again:

```sh
nac-validate data/1_org_global.nac.yaml --verbosity DEBUG
```

!!! failure "Syntax validation: FAILED"
    ```text
    INFO - Artifact layer [local]: schema .schema.yaml
    INFO - Loading of bundles and modules is disabled
    INFO - Loading schema from .schema.yaml
    INFO - No rules found at default path
    INFO - Validate file: data/1_org_global.nac.yaml
    DEBUG - Syntax error 'data/1_org_global.nac.yaml': meraki.domains.[name=US].organizations.[name=Dev-SM].login_security.num_different_passwords: 3 is less than 5

      • data/1_org_global.nac.yaml: meraki.domains.[name=US].organizations.[name=Dev-SM].login_security.num_different_passwords: 3 is less than 5

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Validation Summary
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      ✗ Syntax validation: FAILED (1 error)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ```

A syntax-level violation, caught before anything else runs - semantic
validation doesn't even get a chance to start. Set `num_different_passwords`
back to `5` when you're done, and re-run the command to confirm it passes
again.

### Try it: a semantic failure

`meraki/.rules/101_admin_name.py` is a custom rule: it rejects any
administrator named `root`. Temporarily change `administrator.name` (line 5)
from `admin` to `root`, then run the **exact same command** again - no extra
flags or separate tool invocation needed, `nac-validate` picks up the rules
in `.rules/` automatically:

```sh
nac-validate data/1_org_global.nac.yaml --verbosity DEBUG
```

!!! failure "Semantic validation: FAILED"
    ```text
    INFO - Artifact layer [local]: schema .schema.yaml, rules .rules
    INFO - Loading of bundles and modules is disabled
    INFO - Loading schema from .schema.yaml
    INFO - Loading local rules from .rules
    INFO - Validate file: data/1_org_global.nac.yaml
    INFO - Loading yaml files from [PosixPath('data/1_org_global.nac.yaml')]
    INFO - Verifying rule id 101

    [RULE 101] Admin name must not be 'root'

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      • Admin name must not be 'root' in domain 'US'
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Validation Summary
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      ✓ Syntax validation: PASSED (1 files)
      ✗ Semantic validation: FAILED (1 violation)

        • 1 HIGH severity violation (rules: 101)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ```

The YAML here is perfectly legal syntax - syntax validation still passes -
but it breaks a policy the schema can't express on its own. Change
`administrator.name` back to `admin` when you're done, and re-run the
command to confirm it passes again.

## Plan and Apply

With the file passing both validation layers (and `administrator.name` and
`num_different_passwords` back to their original values), deploy it for
real. Both commands run from `meraki/`.

### `terraform plan`

```sh
terraform plan
```

`plan` is read-only - it computes what Terraform *would* do without
touching your organization, and ends with a summary line:

```text
    }

Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```

`4 to add` is this file's four resources: the merged-model file, the org's
SNMP settings, its login security policy, and its VPN firewall rules.
`0 to change, 0 to destroy` confirms nothing in your org already conflicts
with what you're about to create.

### `terraform apply`

```sh
terraform apply
```

`apply` re-computes the same plan, then stops and asks you to confirm
before it changes anything - only typing `yes` (not just Enter) proceeds:

```text
Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: 
```

Type `yes` and press Enter - this is the first command in the lab that
actually writes to your Meraki organization:

```text
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

!!! tip "Verify in the Dashboard"
    Log in to the Meraki Dashboard and confirm your organization now shows
    the SNMP, login security, and VPN firewall settings from
    `data/1_org_global.nac.yaml`.
